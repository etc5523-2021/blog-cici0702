## Introduction

![Galway Girl--Ed Sheeran](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Q5kA5m5ddaM/maxresdefault.jpg)
This is one of my favorite song from Ed Sheeran. He mentioned the Galway which is a city of Ireland and describes his romantic love with his wife, which arrows my interest of the beautiful city of Ireland. Ireland is an island nation located in Western Europe northwest of the United Kingdom. It's one of the most beautiful land in the world. I did plan to travel but with the COVID pandemic began, all my plans need to be deferred. This report is mainly about the COVID-19 that happens in Ireland. </br>

COVID-19 is caused by a Coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2. The virus that causes COVID-19 is spreading very easily and sustainablely  between people. The disease has since spread worldwide, leading to an ongoing pandemic. Now the official treatment for this is to take vaccinations. This report mainly focuses on the COVID-19 spread in Ireland, which has 4994724 people. This report will introduce the daily new cases and death of COVID-19, and how the speed of taking vaccinations. All the statistics is between 2020/01/22 and 2021/08/27.


## Data Description
The data is from a R package called `tidycovid19` where can be download from git with link: https://github.com/joachim-gassen/tidycovid19. And these data is colllected from Our World in Data (https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-testing). I filter the Ireland of the whole dataset as my report. There are 40 variables in this data, I cleaned the data only with 7 variables. And all these information can be see in table1. </br>

Another dataset is about vaccinations in Ireland, which records the speed of vaccinations. This data is also from Our World in Data(https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations). I also choose part of the data and compared the speed of how many people get first dose and total doses in Ireland, there are 6 variables with date, total vaccinations, first and second doses people, population, and I also count the vaccination rate for comparing. </br>

The third dataset is about the different cities of Ireland, which is from Ireland's Open Data portal(https://data.gov.ie/) and collected by Ordnance Survey Ireland(https://data.gov.ie/dataset/covid19countystatisticshpscireland1?package_type=dataset). This dataset only records the Covid statistics from February 2020 to May 2021, and I am going to explore part of it.

```{r}
df <- download_merged_data(cached = TRUE, silent = TRUE)
ireland <- df %>%
  filter(country == "Ireland")
```

```{r}
daily <- read.csv(here::here("all\ daily.csv")) %>%
  filter(location == "Ireland")

country <- read.csv(here::here("Covid19CountyStatisticsHPSCIreland.csv"))
```


```{r}
cleaned_ie <- ireland %>%
  select(2:6) %>%  
  mutate(newcases = confirmed - lag(confirmed),.before = deaths) %>%
  mutate(newdeaths = deaths - lag(deaths), .before = recovered)
```
## Data Analysis

```{r}
point <- format_format(big.mark = " ", decimal.mark = ",", scientific = FALSE)

totstatis <- cleaned_ie %>%
  summarise(confirmed = max(confirmed),
            deaths = max(deaths),
            recovered = max(recovered)) 
```


The latest data shows that in Ireland, there has been `r scales::comma(totstatis$confirmed) ` people are affected by COVID-19 virus, and `r scales::comma(totstatis$deaths) ` people died of this virus. `r scales::comma(totstatis$recovered) ` people recovered from this virus. Let's move on to the detailed analysis of COVID-19 in Ireland. 

### What is the daily COVID-19 statistics of Ireland ?

```{r}
## separate the date 
case2020 <- cleaned_ie %>%
  mutate(year = year(date)) %>%
  filter(year == "2020") %>%
  mutate(month = month(date)) %>%
  group_by(month) 
case2020$Date <- with(case2020, sprintf("%d-%02d", year, month))
case2020 <- case2020 %>%
  select(4,6,7,10)

case2021<- cleaned_ie %>%
  mutate(year = year(date)) %>%
  filter(year == "2021") %>%
  mutate(month = month(date)) %>%
  group_by(month) 
case2021$Date <- with(case2021, sprintf("%d-%02d", year, month))
case2021 <- case2021 %>%
  select(4,6,7,10)

casetotal <- rbind(case2020,case2021)
  

## sparkline 

casetotal %>%
  group_by(Date)%>%
  summarise(newcases = spk_chr(newcases,
                           type = "line",
                           highlightLineColor = 'orange', 
                           highlightSpotColor = 'orange'),
            newdeaths = spk_chr(newdeaths,
                           type = "line",
                           highlightLineColor = 'orange', 
                           highlightSpotColor = 'orange'),
            recovered = spk_chr(recovered,
                           type = "line",
                           highlightLineColor = 'orange', 
                           highlightSpotColor = 'orange')) %>%
  datatable(escape = F,
              rownames = F,
              options = list(fnDrawCallback = htmlwidgets::JS('function(){
                                                              HTMLWidgets.staticRender();
                                                              }'))
    ) %>% 
    spk_add_deps() 
```


This table includes the date, new cases, new death people and all recovered people by month since January 2020 to August 2021.You can search by month or year as you want in this table. It's a very convenient table for you to measure the COVID impact on Ireland. The horizontal line in January and February of 2020 means there isn't many people to be affected by COVID virus. And the new cases fluctuated heavily in the mid of 2020. However, the recover had a steadily increase and the total recovered people is unchanged so the line is also flat. Moreover, both December and July has a increasing trend of new cases, while the death people is really low and some month only got 0 death. Recently, the recovered people all return from hospital, now the hospital resources are enough for people to get cured. Therefore, the line stays the same while goes down to the 0 due to the latest statistics.



```{r}
# visualize the cases
p1 <- cleaned_ie %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = date))+
  geom_line(aes(y = newcases, color = "newcases"))+
  geom_line(aes(y = newdeaths, color = "newdeaths"))+
  theme_bw()+
  theme(legend.position="bottom")+
  ggtitle("The daily increases of new cases and deaths")

ggplotly(p1) %>%
  layout(legend = list(orientation = "h", x = 0.4, y = -0.2))


```

This graph draws the daily new cases and new deaths, from the graph we can see that there is an extremely increase since the end of 2020 in December and the new cases got a peak on 2020/01/08 with 8227. Similarly, the number of new death also increases a little in the following days. Moreover, in July of 2021, there is going to be a new pandemic wave of Ireland, since the new cases increases gradually and reach a high position of this year. Compared by the number of new deaths, it seems to under control with lower pressure on hospital and more experience of the government. Or definitely you can guess does the vaccinations work ?

### The speed of getting vaccinated

```{r}
## data cleaning
daily_vac <- daily %>%
  select(date,total_vaccinations, people_vaccinated, people_fully_vaccinated,population) %>%
  rename("people-get-1-dose" = people_vaccinated,
         "people-get-2-doses" = people_fully_vaccinated)%>%
  slice(n = (307:546))%>%
  mutate(date = as.Date(date)) %>%
  mutate(vaccination_rate=`people-get-2-doses`/ population*100) %>%
  filter(!is.na(total_vaccinations))

p2 <- ggplot(daily_vac,
       aes(x = date))+
  geom_area(aes(y = total_vaccinations, alpha = 0.3, fill = "total_vaccinations"), color = "blue")+
  geom_area(aes(y = `people-get-1-dose`, fill = "people-get-1-dose"),alpha = 0.3,color = "yellow")+
  geom_area(aes(y = `people-get-2-doses`, alpha = 0.3, fill = "people-get-2-doses"), color = "green")+
  theme_bw()+
  labs(title = "Vaccinations of Ireland",
       caption = "Source: Our World in Data")+
  theme(legend.position="bottom")
  
ggplotly(p2) %>%
  layout(legend = list(orientation = "h", x = 0.4, y = -0.2))
```

The vaccination has been strongly recommended as one of the effective method to against COVID virus. In Ireland, the spread of vaccination began at the end of 2020, while in January there was the highest increasing then. The speed of getting vaccination is really fast, the blue part is the total vaccinations, the pink part is the first dose vaccination and the green part is the fully doses. The pink line and the green line is getting closer. Until 2021-08-25, the fully vaccination is 3297241 and the total population of Ireland is 4982904. Therefore, the total vaccination rate is 66%. This is in a leading position all over the world.



### Does increasing cases related to the population ? </br>

```{r}
population <- country %>%
  select(CountyName,PopulationCensus16) %>%
  unique() %>%
  arrange(-PopulationCensus16)%>%
  head(10)
knitr::kable(population, caption = "The top10 cities'population in Ireland") %>%
   kable_styling(position = "center")
```

The table presents the top 10 cities of Ireland, where the capital city is Dublin with the highest population at `r population$PopulationCensus16[1]`, and followed by the Cork and Galway.

```{r}
country_tidy <- country %>%
  select(3:5,8:9,10:14) %>%
  mutate(Date= as.Date(TimeStamp)) %>%
  mutate(month = months(Date),
         year = year(Date)) %>%
  filter(year == "2021") %>%
  group_by(CountyName, month,PopulationCensus16) %>%
  summarise(monthly_cases = max(ConfirmedCovidCases)) %>%
  arrange(CountyName)
## count the increasing rate
region <-country_tidy %>%
  mutate(increasing_rate = round(monthly_cases / PopulationCensus16 * 100,2))
region$increasing_rate = paste(region$increasing_rate,"%")

region_compare <- region %>%
  select(CountyName, month, increasing_rate) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = "month",
              values_from = "increasing_rate")
region_compare <- region_compare %>%
  relocate(January, February, March, April, May, .after = CountyName)


knitr::kable(region_compare, caption = "Increased cases in different cities of Ireland from January to May in 2021") %>%
   kable_styling(position = "center") %>%
  scroll_box(height = "400px")
```


This table contains the total 26 cities' increasing rate in 2021 from January to May. Above all, the highest increasing rate is Monaghan which leads the first place of all month with nearly 8% increasing rate. However, it doesn't belong to the top10 largest population city in the above table. The city who with second highest increasing rate is Louth, which is also not in the Table1. Reversely, the capital city Dublin gets around 6% increasing rate and the second largest population city Cork only gets 4% around increasing rate. Therefore, the more people doesn't means the higher increasing rate.

## Conclusion
Through the changing number of cases and death, the government and the public all devote themselves to make people's lives better. The vaccinations of Ireland will spread more, and I hope the pandemic would disappear in the coming days. At then, our world will back to normal and we will have more chances to love the world. Peace and love.
